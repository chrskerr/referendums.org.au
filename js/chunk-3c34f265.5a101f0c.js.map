Australians and politicians need to be aware of this platform. <strong>Nothing will change without substantial pressure from the Australian population</strong> via use of the platform, and without the support of a handful to politicians. I want to turn this into a movement, and make this project the property of the people of Australia. We need real issues to vote on from actual politicians, we need vote participation, and eventually funding to cover infrastructure costs. <strong>If we make our voice heard via weight of numbers, then we cannot be ignored.</strong>\n\t\t\t\t</p>    \n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\texport default {\n\tname: 'whitepaper',\n\t}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n\tp {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 1em;\n\t}\n\tli {\n\t\tmargin-left: 1em;\n\t}\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=template&id=72ddcab2&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=72ddcab2&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"72ddcab2\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=72ddcab2&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Whitepaper.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=72ddcab2&scoped=true&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
