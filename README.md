# WeVote


## Intent
I am building an application which Australian's can use for fast, secure, reliable and immutable referendum voting. 

I am intending to push this as an open-source, open-participation, communited held project to prevent it being consumed into a closed, hidden and expensive consultant-led project. 

Australian's should be able to see and determine how their votes are being held.

This is currently a proof of concept, but I believe that the idea has legs and could help re-engage Australians in the governance of our nation. Politician trust is a low as it ever is, it is time that we took control of the decisions that they made. 

## Please help
I am looking for people who can help with the code, with the execution, UX/UI, strategy, everything. 

The back-end also needs a lot of work. The "blockchain" is very immature and the system is blended into another Node server I was running for simplicities sake. I will split this out into its own project & repo as soon as necessary.
